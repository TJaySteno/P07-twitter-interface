## Project 7
### Build a Twitter Interface

In this project, I have used Express alongside Pug to request and display information from Twitter. This information includes my own info, my 5 most recent tweets, 5 of my followers, and 5 direct messages from my most recent conversation. Of course, supplemental information on Tweets and DMs (likes, retweets, time posted, etc.) will be displayed as well. For this project, I was given HTML and CSS that I reformatted to be used with Express and Pug.

*__Skills:__ Node.js, Express, Pug/Jade, Twitter API*

*__Personal Development Emphasis:__ Further review on async/await and APIs, and experimenting with Express middleware and Pug layouts*

__Grade:__ Exceeds Expectations

__Grader's Overall Comments:__ "Excellent work! Your Twitter App project is awesome! You’re handling your dependencies, config file, and your .gitignore file very nicely. Your routes, requires and requests are on point. Your rendered templates look the part. Your code and directory look clean and well organized. And nice work hitting some exceeds here. That’s great to see. Fantastic work all around!

"As you move on to your next project, keep up the great work! And keep shooting for those exceeds grades! The time spent attempting to hit those exceeds criteria will strengthen your skills and give you cooler projects to show off at the end of this Techdegree.

"Your next proj is all about Gulp, which is an awesome tool with all sorts of power that every developer should have in their arsenal. Gulp’s syntax may look new to you and at this point, it may seem like a whole new thing to cram in your already over-worked and over-filled head, but once you get the hang of it, you’ll see that it’s really just like JS written in its own sort of unique way, and it’s nothing that someone with your skills can’t handle. :)

"Good luck and happy coding as you move forward! You rock! :)"

#### _Special Instructions for Setup_

This app uses the Twitter API and therefore requires an API key to use. Getting one is a simple matter of going to [https://apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com) and applying for a free key. Make sure to go to 'Permissions' and give your key access to Read, Write, and Direct Messages, otherwise the app is likely to break down. Once that has been changed, go to 'Keys and Access Tokens' for your unique keys, plug them into the provided file 'config-template.js', and rename that file to 'config.js'. Then just install dependencies and you're off!
