## Project 7
### Twitter Interface

Using Node.js, request information from Twitter and display it in the provided interface. This information includes my own info, the 5 most recent posts on my home timeline, 5 of my followers, and up to 5 messages from my most recent conversation. Of course, information on Tweets and DMs such as likes, retweets, time since posting, etc. will be included. Overall, this project simulates converting information found on a public API into a template passed down from the design team.
